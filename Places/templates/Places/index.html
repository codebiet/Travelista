        <p class="secTag text-big">Hawa Mahal, Jaipur</p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The Hawa Mahal in Jaipur is considered as one of the most iconic
            attractions of the city. The five-storey building looks like a honeycomb of a beehive and it is always
            windy inside, owing to the numerous windows and jharokhas. This amazing ventilation that the palace
            enjoys is the reason why it was named as the Hawa Mahal, which literally translates into the “Palace of
            the Winds”.The Hawa Mahal is dedicated to Lord Krishna. It is said that the shape of the building
            resembles the crown of Krishna. More than a palace, the Hawa Mahal is also a cultural and architectural
            marvel that reflects a truly harmonious amalgamation of the Hindu Rajput and Islamic Mughal
            architectural styles.</p>
