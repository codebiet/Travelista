            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The Hawa Mahal in Jaipur is considered as one of the most iconic
                attractions of the city. The five-storey building looks like a honeycomb of a beehive and it is always
                windy inside, owing to the numerous windows and jharokhas. This amazing ventilation that the palace
                enjoys is the reason why it was named as the Hawa Mahal, which literally translates into the “Palace of
                the Winds”.The Hawa Mahal is dedicated to Lord Krishna. It is said that the shape of the building
                resembles the crown of Krishna. More than a palace, the Hawa Mahal is also a cultural and architectural
                marvel that reflects a truly harmonious amalgamation of the Hindu Rajput and Islamic Mughal
                architectural styles.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The very name Manali evokes visual of snow-covered mountains, stately
                deodar tree, apple archards and tumbling Beas. So lucky are these who have opted for Manali, a calm and
                quite place in the Western Himalayas as their holidays destination.
                Away from the din and noice of the cities, it is a veritable dreams words where bountiful nature offers
                variety of pleasures to all types of tourists having varying tastes. It is a nature lover’s paradise.
                For the overworked urbanite, it is an ideal place to relex. The honey mooners enjoy ‘as you like it’
                liberty.
                The salubrious air of the valley fills the doting old personos with energy to spend the rest of their
                evenings of life happily devoid of any ailments associated with old age.</p>
